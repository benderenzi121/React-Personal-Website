                                <p>Hi, my name is Ben DeRenzi. I have had a long-time interest in computer software and hardware, so it was natural for me to study computer science for my bachelorâ€™s degree. I am currently focused on web development but am interested in other areas of development as well. I built this website so that anyone looking to see my work or contact me would have all the information they would need in one place. Some of my hobbies include: Hiking, Camping, Fishing, video games, and meditation.</p>
